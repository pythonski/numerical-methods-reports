This is a collection of the final reports I have written for the exam "Numerical Methods in Theoretical Physics" at the University of Pisa. 

The project is divided into three modules: 
1. A study of the classical two-dimensional Ising model using standard Markov chain methods;
2. The analogous one-dimensional quantum model, implement with exact diagonalization;
3. A discussion of the statistical physics of the quantum harmonic oscillator, employing MC methods based on the path integral information.

Most of the projects (which I will likely upload at a later time) are coded in Python with snippets of Fortran and C. For any further information refer to the reports themselves.
